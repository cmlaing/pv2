            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>
                During a work experience placement, I was introduced to 
                <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">
                Shopify.</a> On my own test website I was able to explore the 
                platform and start to learn a new language, Liquid. My first 
                task was to create a custom section and get 
                familiar with the Dawn theme. Later, for a different 
                store, I migrated products from Squarespace to Shopify and 
                adjusted the details when necessary. 
            </p>
            

            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>
                I was asked to create a custom section on a website that was 
                completely new to me, in a language I hadn't heard of until 
                that very day. This was a challenge, and I approached it by 
                first educating myself as much as possible. I started very 
                basic and learned what the differences were between sections, 
                blocks, assets, what a schema actually does, and how to build a 
                theme. I made a very basic schema and constantly tested the 
                code as I went. This particular section featured a slideshow 
                that wasn't built into the theme. I used a plugin from 
                <a href="https://flickity.metafizzy.co/" target="_blank">
                Flickity</a> and built some code around that. I was very 
                close, but couldn't quite nail it to the way that I wanted 
                it to look. At this point my mentor stepped in and showed 
                me a working example that he made. This was valuable as it showed 
                me exactly where I was missing the mark and now I 
                feel much more confident in this area. 

            </p>
            <p>
                For the migration, I had the products in a spreadsheet file 
                that had to be transferred to a template that Shopify would 
                recognize. This was quite simple, just a matter of lining things 
                up where they needed to be. Once it looked good, I imported the 
                new products. There was a problem with some of the images transferring
                over. After troubleshooting, it was because the original URLs were 
                not valid and I had to insert a placeholder image URL in a few 
                cases. Once the transfer was complete, I manually swapped out 
                the placeholder images for the true product images. After checking 
                that everything else transferred over correctly, I was done. 
            </p>

            <h2>Things I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest things I learned are how to navigate the Liquid 
                language, build custom sections, and migrate products into Shopify. 
                

            </p>
            <p>
                The largest learning curve was learning Liquid and how it 
                can be utilized to build custom sections. The existing theme 
                had a ton of files already, so navigating what was already there 
                and feeling confident enough to adjust things here or there was 
                something I needed to fully understand before 
                messing around with. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I did find that Liquid is similar to PHP 
                in some ways, so that was a connection I was able to make. Once 
                I understood the structure of schemas and blocks, it became more 
                straight-forward. I liked how it can be combined with HTML and 
                CSS, much like PHP. 

            </p>
            <p>
                The Shopify migration part taught me how exactly products are 
                migrated, along with all their descriptions, images, and details 
                like quantities, taxes, categories, etc. I became familiar with 
                the help section of Shopify's website and feel like if there is 
                something else I am unsure of in the future, I can easily find 
                what I am looking for. 

            </p>


            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                Shopify is a platform that is growing in popularity. I feel that 
                it is an important aspect of web development that I should know. 
                This experience has given me a great overview of the platform 
                with some detailed experience in creating my own sections for a 
                pre-built theme. I was exposed to a new language and now feel 
                confident that I can write basic code in Liquid when 
                necessary. In addition, I had practice migrating products for 
                a client that had an existing store on Squarespace. This was 
                not an example from a tutorial, but a real-world situation 
                that I was able to do quite well.
