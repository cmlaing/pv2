            <h2>The Project</h2>

            <p>
              The purpose of the project was to create an employee directory based upon 
              gathering information for 12 individuals and displaying them on a page. A JSON 
              object was requested from the API, fetched, parsed, and then displayed in a grid 
              so each employee had their own "card" with name, email, location, and image. 
              In addition, clicking the employee's card opened up a modal window with 
              further information like birthday and address. This project was heavy on 
              JavaScript and was my first attempt at using an API. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I was given a link for an API to use called 
              <a href="https://randomuser.me/" target="_blank">Random User Generator API </a>
              and two mockup images for the desktop view and the modal view. 
              There was a study guide available for assistance, but all the code was 
              written by myself. JavaScript was the main focus but I also implemented 
              Flexbox for the layout of the cards and the inside of the cards. 

            </p>

            <h2>The Approach</h2>

            <p>
              The modal window uses an event listener for the user to click the arrows 
              to cycle through employees. I learned about event listeners in a previous 
              project so using them here seemed like a good idea. The only issue I had 
              was minor - clicking the "X" to close the window didn't 
              close the window. I knew there was a 
              display:hidden feature in CSS so I explored that in JavaScript and sure enough, 
              found the same concept and was able to make it work. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A previous project had a live search feature that I decided to use here as 
              well. When you start typing letters in the search bar, it will update live and 
              show matching results as you type. For example, if you had some employees with 
              the names Steve, Stephan, and Stewart, then typing "ste" in the search bar 
              will bring up all three names. I used the act of typing as the JavaScript 
              event, then used that to loop through all the card entries on the page and 
              display only the ones that match the criteria. 
            </p>

            <h2>Things I Learned</h2>


            <p>
              I learned how to use fetch requests and deal with the results by translating 
              into JSON and then to something to actually display on the page. Functions 
              were used to display the employee's data with a "for each" loop for name, 
              email, city, and picture. I combined this with some HTML to be inserted into 
              a div to display nicely on the page. The combination of fetch requests, parsing 
              into JSON, looping through the data, and then displaying it dynamically was 
              new to me. I found it straight-forward and didn't have any issues that I 
              recall. 
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I felt this project was quite straight forward and was the quickest for me to 
                complete. As it is meant to be primarily functional, that is what I focused on 
                by having a neat grid with very little styling. Each employee's information is 
                clearly stated and organized in a way that is easy to read. I added a 
                drop-shadow to the card box when the user hovers the mouse over the card, and 
                used that same card as the focus element in the search bar. The search bar 
                dynamically searches as you type, so the cards get updated live as the search 
                term becomes more specific. 

            </p>
