              In my spare time, I like to experiment with different languages and 
              online tutorials.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have created a few smaller things in my spare time including a 
                text-based Tic Tac Toe game, a 2D collecting game (similar to Snake), 
                and a sensor-activated robot.  
            </p>

            <p>
                I received a subscription box from Robobox and created a 
                sensor-activated robot with Arduino. The kit included 
                3D printed parts, electronic circuits, and instructions. I had 
                to connect wires and write the code for it it work.  
                It was coded in C# and I was successful at making the alarm 
                go off when I waved my hand in front of it. It was fun! This is 
                a field I have a strong interest in and want to explore more 
                in-depth.
            </p>


            

            <p>
                YouTube is a great source for tutorials. I have followed along 
                with some tutorials to create text-based games in C++ like 
                Tic Tac Toe, a knock-off of "Snake", and a very basic 
                adventure ASCII game with the player battling against 
                monsters using a random number generator to determine attack 
                and defense. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The adventure ASCII game is about as basic as it can get for an 
              adventure game. There is a text map and the player is shown by the "@" 
              character. Other letters on the screen are various monsters. Walls are created 
              using the "#" symbol. For fun, I wrote out my last name under the map. It 
              doesn't have any applicable purpose for the game itself. Each dot is a space 
              that the user is able to move to using the keyboard arrows. When approached 
              with a monster, a random number generator involves a loop to determine if the 
              player is successful or not. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Tic Tac Toe is also very basic. The player inputs the x and y coordinates 
              for the grid and it displays on the screen. Another player sitting next 
              to the first player "in real life" will also use the keyboard to enter 
              their own coordinates. 
            </p>

            <p>Some images below show the text-based games. It allowed me to get more 
              familiar with C++ and the logic involved in programming. Although it isn't 
              exactly relevant to web design and development, the act of paying 
              attention to detail, testing and checking, and keeping organized to make 
              the parts and the whole work together are still key concepts.
