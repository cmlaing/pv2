              In my spare time, I like to experiment with different languages and 
              online tutorials. I'm always eager to learn something new and simple 
              game development has been one of those areas. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I have created a few smaller things including a 
                text-based Tic Tac Toe game, a 2D collecting game (similar to Snake), 
                and a sensor-activated robot.  Most of these were from YouTube or 
                text tutorials. I followed the tutorials pretty much exactly how 
                they were laid out with some originality thrown in when 
                appropriate. I would definitely say I am at the beginner 
                stage of C++, but I do understand concepts like classes, 
                variables, and various algorithms. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have some 
                experience with Java, and that was where I learned about 
                the basics of back-end programming. I have taken a couple of 
                university level course from Thompson Rivers University. 
                These included 
                <a href="https://www.tru.ca/distance/courses/comp1131.html" target="_blank">
                COMP 1131 - Computer Programming
                </a>
                and
                <a href="https://www.tru.ca/distance/courses/comp2231.html" target="_blank">
                COMP 2231 - Data Structures and Algorithms.</a> 
                I learned about classes, objects, conditionals, loops, arrays, 
                recursion, 
                <a href="TRU/umldiagram.jpg" target="_blank">
                UML diagrams</a>,
                searching and sorting algorithms, stacks, queues, lists, 
                iterators, trees, binary search trees, heaps, graphs, and hashing.

                These are java files that I converted to text files, but 
                if you are interested, check them out! The first is an example 
                about using objects, whereas the second is a bit more useful and 
                calculates the distance between two points after inputting the X and Y 
                coordinates. The card program randomly prints 5 cards to the screen 
                and states the number and suit of each (e.g. "Two of Hearts"). 
                I also have a small example of my first time using a try/catch 
                sequence. 
                <ul>

                  <li><a href="TRU/distanceXY.txt" target="_blank">Distance Program</a></li>

                  <li><a href="TRU/AverageExceptionExample.txt" target="_blank">Try/Catch Exception</a></li>
                </ul>
                As you can see, these are just little assignments to show my 
                understanding of things like variables, classes, objects, loops, etc. 
                The exams were written on paper with absolutely no access to a computer or 
                internet. I had to memorize everything and be able to write it down from scratch. 
                There were no copy/paste shortcuts - I literally had to write entire programs by 
                hand, by memory, for the exams. It was really hard but I feel like the concepts 
                stuck with me more, even though I haven't coded in Java for a couple of years. 
                Of course, I feel like I would need to review some of the harder concepts for 
                me (hashing, binary trees, etc) before flying at it, but many of the concepts 
                have stuck with me and have been used in other languages, like C++. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I received a subscription box from Robobox and created a 
                sensor-activated robot with Arduino. The kit included 
                3D printed parts, electronic circuits, and instructions. I had 
                to connect wires and write the code for it it work.  
                It was 
                <a href="alarm.txt" target="_blank">
                coded in C# </a>and I was successful at making the alarm 
                go off when I waved my hand in front of it. It was fun! This is 
                a field I have a strong interest in and want to explore more 
                in-depth. The website I ordered it from does not have it anymore, 
                but I did find a link to the RoboBox website. It is based 
                in France, so you need to translate it from French, but 
                <a href="https://www.robobox.fr/" target="_blank"> here it is</a>
                if you are interested. I did the first box with the infra-red alarm. 
            </p>

                YouTube is a great source for tutorials. I have followed along 
                with some tutorials to create text-based games in C++ like 
                Tic Tac Toe, a knock-off of "Snake", and a very basic 
                adventure ASCII game with the player battling against 
                monsters using a random number generator to determine attack 
                and defense. These were C++ based. I started to look up how to 
                write games in Java, but quickly found that C++ was the preferred 
                language so I decided to roll with it and see what happens. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The adventure ASCII game is about as basic as it can get for an 
              adventure game. There is a text map and the player is shown by the "@" 
              character. Other letters on the screen are various monsters. Walls are created 
              using the "#" symbol. For fun, I wrote out my last name under the map. It 
              doesn't have any applicable purpose for the game itself. Each dot is a space 
              that the user is able to move to using the keyboard arrows. When approached 
              with a monster, a random number generator involves a loop to determine if the 
              player is successful or not. This was written in C++. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Tic Tac Toe is also very basic. The player inputs the x and y coordinates 
              for the grid and it displays on the screen. Another player sitting next 
              to the first player "in real life" will also use the keyboard to enter 
              their own coordinates. This was also written in C++. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Some images below show the text-based games. It allowed me to get more 
              familiar with C++ and the logic involved in programming. Although it isn't 
              directly related to web design and development, the act of paying 
              attention to detail, testing and checking, and keeping organized to make 
              the parts and the whole work together are still key concepts.
