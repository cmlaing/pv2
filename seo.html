            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>
                During a work experience placement, I was able to learn about 
                search engine optimization (SEO) and put it into action. I conducted 
                keyword research and built quality content for six different 
                websites. Some also involved Google Analytics and Google Tags, where 
                I created appropriate tags to measure the long term effectiveness 
                of the content I created. I also heavily researched for 
                appropriate niche market ideas for a rank and rent website. 
            </p>
            

            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>
                Going into the work experience placement, I had very little 
                knowledge of SEO. When given my first task, my mentor gave me a 
                couple of links to some blog articles about what SEO is and the 
                general idea of what he was looking for. I expanded on this by 
                watching tutorials on YouTube, reading informative blog posts about 
                the topic, and I enrolled in some online courses to get the full 
                picture. Once I had researched the keywords and written up some 
                content, I asked my mentor to have a look and he seemed pleased with 
                the work I did. He kept giving me different websites to create 
                SEO content for and I ended up working on six different websites 
                in a six week period. 

            </p>

            <h2>Things I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                The entire topic of SEO and its importance in web design was an 
                eye-opening experience. The depth of keyword research, building 
                quality content, and engaging users enough to drive conversions is 
                as much an art as it is a science. SEO is a long term endeavor that 
                involves constant monitoring and adjusting based on the data-driven 
                decisions the developer needs to make. 
            </p>
            <p>

                I learned what SEO is and some appropriate tools to use during research 
                like 
                <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank">
                Ahrefs</a>, 
                <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=CA" target="_blank">
                Google Trends</a>, 
                <a href="https://answerthepublic.com/" target="_blank">
                Answer The Public</a>,  
                <a href="https://analytics.google.com" target="_blank">
                Google Analytics</a>, 
                <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/" target="_blank">
                Google Tag Manager</a>, and 
                <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/" target="_blank">
                Google Data Studio.</a>
                I had plenty of practice 
                writing content on subjects I knew nothing about and had to research 
                myself. The websites had between 4 - 15 pages of content each. Some 
                were full pages while others were small paragraph snippets. The full 
                pages offered more room to delve deep into the topics, and the short 
                paragraphs were condensed versions that had to be carefully fine-tuned 
                to be just as effective as a full page. I also wrote SERP details 
                like meta titles and descriptions using keywords in an easy to 
                understand and direct format. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some subjects I wrote about included mortage services, lawyer 
                services, Shopify migration, native art jewelry, photo 
                booth services, cooking classes, and topics for a podcast about 
                missing persons.
            </p>
            <p>

                Rank and rent was another new concept in this subfield that I 
                discovered. Plenty of research and competitive analyses were 
                conducted to try to find a niche market that would be 
                profitable for my mentor. To protect his business, I will not 
                reveal what topics I had narrowed it down to, but this was a 
                section that involved understanding statistical data and 
                thinking outside the box to predict the future. I used 
                <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank">
                Ahrefs</a> 
                to conduct batch analyses on competitor websites and really 
                looked at the nitty gritty details of backlinks, top pages, 
                traffic, keyword difficulty, domain rating, website layout 
                and content, and more. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Google Analytics and Google Tags were another new aspect 
                that complimented the SEO work that I did. By understanding 
                the importance of user acquisition and engagement, I was able 
                to create tags and triggers to measure user behaviour on 
                a couple of websites. I made tags to measure things like 
                scroll depth, form submission success and failures, 
                newsletter signsup, and 
                targeted specific forms, buttons, and links to determine 
                which ones were being utilized and which ones were being 
                ignored. I had practice with both Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and 
                Universal Analytics (UA). 

            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                SEO is a fascinating topic that I have continued to explore 
                even though the work experience placement has ended. It is a 
                huge topic that really needs constant attention in order to 
                be up to date with new trends and search engine updates. There 
                are many pieces to this puzzle and I feel confident that I have 
                a solid basis on the theory of how to do this right, plus some 
                real experience that was approved by someone successful in 
                this field.
