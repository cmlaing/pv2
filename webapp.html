            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>
              The purpose of the project was to create a web application that demonstrated 
              the use of chart widgets and localStorage using JavaScript. CSS Grid and Flexbox 
              were used primarily for the layout. I was given mockup images for the mobile, 
              tablet, and desktop views, along with a link to 
              <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank"> charts.js</a>. There was a 
              study guide but it was very problematic and sparse. There was outdated 
              information and it was more a headache to use than a help, so I ditched 
              it and learned what I needed to know on my own. 
              This was the largest project to date and I felt going into it that it would 
              be a great test to see just how much knowledge I had learned up to that point. 
              Previous projects had bits and pieces provided but this one was to be done 
              from scratch. I was excited to get into it and learn some new techniques. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The main learning curve with this project was learning how to implement 
              the charts. I used the information from 
              <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank"> charts.js</a>
              to build each section step-by-step. Each section had its own set of 
              new problems that I was able to solve.
            </p>
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>
              The alert banner was where I found my first problem. This was from some 
              misinformation from the study guide. I corrected the issue and informed 
              my fellow Treehouse students and instructor. This was about when I decided 
              to stop using the study guide and challenge myself to just build it myself. 
              The problem was simple - pressing the "X" to close the alert banner did 
              not close it at all. The solution was to reference a different variable 
              and set its display to "none".
            </p>
            <p>
              In the top right corner, next to the user, is a notification bell. When 
              there are notifications a green dot appears on the bell. After you click 
              the bell and see a drop down menu of notifications, the green dot disappears. 
              For this, I needed to learn how to make drop down menus in JavaScript. 
              I did some reading and stumbled upon a 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxWqBRqAGLo"> YouTube Video</a> 
              that really helped. When I come across something that is new or not 
              working the way I expect, the first thing I do is look it up. Spending 
              15 minutes researching has saved me a lot of time because I am not 
              being frustrated going in circles and wondering why it isn't working. 
              This way I get my answer quickly and can test and check. 
              I usually look at least 3-5 resources/examples to understand the concept 
              of the code and then I give it a try for what I am trying to create. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Toggle switches were another new feature I learned while doing this 
              project. I needed two toggle switches (email, profile) and a drop down menu for 
              timezones. 
              The tricky 
              part about this was to use local storage to save the selections. 
              The problem is that I hadn't done this before, so I started by making 
              a list of things I thought I needed to know in order to make progress.
              My list involved, 
              <ol>
                <li>Create a seperate div class for each toggle switch</li>
                <li>Look up JavaScript for basic toggle switches</li>
                <li>Save the choice to local storage (connect to save/cancel buttons)</li>
                <li>Style the switches to match the mockup</li>
              </ol>
              At one point I came across 
              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp"> this link </a>
              about toggle switches and I realized I probably didn't need all those div 
              classes that I originally thought. The result was not what I expected, 
              so I tried 
              <a href="https://ghinda.net/css-toggle-switch/index.html"> another resource </a>
              but only implemented toggle-switch.css to my project. I got it to work and 
              it looked better than the other version, so I decided to use this as my 
              starting point and add the styles later.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next step was to learn how to make local storage work. I read a few things 
              and came across <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26628812/localstorage-how-to-save-a-checkbox">
              this stackoverflow link</a> and 
              <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/localstorage-javascript-complete-guide/#howdoeslocalstoragework">
              this blog post</a>. I put in some unique IDs and tried to create the save function. 
              After awhile of it not working despite looking things up, I emailed my instructor for help. 
              Thankfully, he found a mistake where I included a JSON.parse() that was unnecessary. I 
              had thought it was necessary because I was using it for the other get requests and 
              those worked just fine. So it was ok to use for toggle switches but not saving a 
              drop down menu item (timezone). 
        
            </p>
            <h2>Things I Learned</h2>

            <p>
              This project was the largest one to date and I was able to learn quite a few 
              new things. I was able to use CSS Grid and Flexbox in more depth for the 
              layout, and as a result was able to really appreciate how powerful these 
              tools are for a layout with subsections, or widgets. I also learned how to 
              utilize the JavaScript chart.js resource, local storage, and improved 
              my skills with JavaScript functions via the message sent confirmation, alert 
              banner, toggle switches, timezone menu, and notification bell. 
              SVG images were another new feature that I found I quite liked using due to 
              how easy it is to adapt their size, shape, and color without losing image 
              quality. 

            </p>
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
            Overall, this project demonstrates a modular approach of having multiple 
            sections come together in a coherent design. JavaScript plugins keep the 
            chart information up to date without having to manually update the webpage 
            itself.
