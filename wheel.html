            <h2>The Project</h2>

            <p>
              This is a word-guessing game built primarily with JavaScript. It is a mix 
              between Wheel of Fortune and Hangman. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The goal of the game is to correctly guess the phrase on the screen before 
                running out of lives. Each "life" is shown as a heart icon on screen. A 
                correct guess will display the appropriate letter in the phrase, while an 
                incorrect guess will result in the loss of a heart token. The game ends when 
                the phrase is correctly guessed or the user runs out of heart tokens. 

            </p>

            <p>
                An on-screen keyboard allows the user to select a letter with their mouse. 
                Correct letters appear in the phrase and the selected letter becomes disabled 
                on the keyboard as to not repeat already guessed letters. Different overlays 
                for a win or lose situation appear with the option to play again. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Approach</h2>

            <p>
              The point of the game is to guess a phrase, so I made up some phrases and 
              put them into an array. I then created a function that randomly chose 
              one of the phrases from that array list. Once chosen, I needed to display 
              the phrase so I created another function just for that. This one used 
              a "for loop" that took each character and turned it into a list item. 
              Each item was changed to uppercase, so that it didn't matter how I 
              originally wrote it in the phrase list. This was also so that it would 
              match the input from the on screen keyboard. I had another conditional 
              for nonletters (spaces) that added a "space" or "letter" class to the item. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The next part was communicating between the code and the onscreen keyboard. 
              I needed a function that checked if the letter chosen from the onscreen 
              keyboard matched any letters in the phrase. I used another "for loop" 
              in this function that added a "show" class to the item if it matched. 
              Of course, this also meant I needed an event listener for the keyboard 
              itself, so that was the next task I completed. Once the letter was 
              clicked, the "chosen" class got assigned and the letter could no longer 
              be clicked (it was disabled). In this event listener, I included another 
              conditional for the heart token/lives. If the letter was not in the phrase, 
              then a heart token would be taken away. I created a variable called "missed" 
              and incremented it for each instance of a missed letter. The last part of 
              this segment was to call another function, checkWin(), to see if that last 
              letter choice was enough to win the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              The checkWin() function used an "if/else" statement for a win or lose 
              situation. The "win" situation meant a new overlay/screen would appear 
              letting the user know they had won the game. I didn't like how 
              boring it looked, so I added an old picture I took of some kittens 
              in my dad's workboots. Since it was a fun, casual game I felt some 
              kittens were appropriate to spruce it up a bit. There was also 
              a "Play Again" button on the screen that refreshed the game to a new 
              phrase and full heart tokens. The "lose" situation was a different 
              overlay with a "Play Again" button and a red background. 
            </p>

            <!-- todo this part is too short, seems like i learned nothing-->
            <h2>Things I Learned</h2>

            <p>
                This project was quite heavy on JavaScript. It allowed me to further my skills 
                in manipulating arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, appending nodes, 
                and event listeners. Aside from the obvious practice of using JavaScript 
                more in general, the logical approach for how to solve the "problem" of 
                making a game was a great learning experience. I had some guidance 
                in figuring out what kinds of functions I needed to make, but actually 
                making the functions and having them all connect together the way I wanted 
                was a critical aspect of my understanding of JavaScript.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I felt like after this project, I am much more comfortable with 
                event listeners, loops, and conditionals because of how much I used 
                them. Prior to going into this, I was familiar with working with arrays 
                so that was a strong point that stayed consistant throughout the project. 
                I was able to practice appending nodes with the appendChild() built-in 
                function. I used this with the phrase when checking if the 
                character was a letter or a space. After the check, it was appended 
                to a list in order to then be displayed on the screen. Understanding 
                the DOM tree was a new concept that got put into action with this 
                project. I used it again on the "win" overlay screen by appending 
                a photo of some kittens to the overlay, so I feel more comfortable 
                knowing when it is a good time to use this tool. 

                
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              It was fun to try to make an interactive game. When I first expressed a serious 
              interest in programming, the first thing I did was look up how to make 
              a game. (You can read more about that <a href="creative.html"> here if 
              you are interested.
              </a>) So when I saw that Treehouse was offering a game as one of the projects, 
              I was quite intrigued! 
            </p>
            <p>
              I liked that I was able to enhance my JavaScript skills. Going into this 
              project, I felt like my skills were a bit on the weaker side and could 
              really benefit from some extra practice. I wanted to practice more with 
              functions and conditionals and that is exactly what I got done. I feel 
              more confident in that area after completing this project. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In the future, I would like to expand on this project. The title 
              "Wheel of Success" is a bit misleading, as there is no wheel involved. I think 
              with what I know with CSS and JavaScript, I might be able to create a spinning 
              wheel with letters or symbols and have that link to a phrase or match 
              another component. This project is inspiring for me to continue to learn in 
              a new direction. 
            </p>
